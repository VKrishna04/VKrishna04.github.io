This is a placeholder for the resume PDF file.
To use your actual resume:

1. Replace this file with your actual resume PDF
2. Name it "resume.pdf" and place it in the public folder
3. Or update the settings.json file to use an external URL

The resume download functionality is now fully integrated with the settings.json configuration.
